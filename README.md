## About This Repo

This is the source code for the M3+ Mutual Mentoring website. It's built with **Next.js 14** and **TypeScript**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and content is managed through plain **Markdown files** — no database or CMS required.

Most day-to-day changes (events, team, testimonials, page copy) happen entirely in the `content/` folder without touching any code.

---

## ✏️ For Content Editors
*No coding required for any of the tasks below.*

### Add an Upcoming Event

Upcoming events are managed entirely through **Luma** — no file changes needed.

1. Go to [lu.ma/m3plus](https://lu.ma/m3plus) and sign in
2. Create a new event in the M3+ calendar
3. The event will appear automatically on the website's Events page

The Luma calendar embed updates in real time. No code edits or markdown files required.

---

### Archive a Past Event

After an event has taken place, add it to the archive so the community can access photos and resources:

1. **Copy the template:** Duplicate `content/events/archive/_template.md` and rename it to match the event (e.g., `my-event-name.md`). The slug (filename without `.md`) becomes the URL: `/events/my-event-name`.

2. **Fill in the required fields:**

```yaml
---
title: "Your Event Title"
date: "2025-10-30"           # Used for sorting — YYYY-MM-DD format
displayDate: "Thursday, October 30"
time: "6:00 PM – 8:30 PM"
location: "5445 Legacy Dr, Plano, Texas"
description: "A short description of the event."
isUpcoming: false
year: 2025
image: "/images/events/your-event-slug.jpg"   # Optional thumbnail
---
```

3. **Add Google Drive links** (fill these in after uploading to Drive):

```yaml
# Upload photos to a Drive folder, set sharing to "Anyone with the link", paste URL here:
photosDriveUrl: "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/..."

# Upload slides/handouts to a Drive folder, paste URL here:
resourcesDriveUrl: "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/..."

# For the slideshow viewer — paste the Google Slides share URL:
# (The site automatically embeds it as an interactive slideshow)
slideshowUrl: "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/.../edit?usp=sharing"
```

4. **Commit and push to GitHub** → Netlify deploys automatically.

> See `content/events/archive/_template.md` for the full list of optional fields with inline documentation.

---

### Update Page Copy

Each page has a corresponding Markdown file in `content/pages/` with YAML fields at the top. Edit the values to update text on the live site:

| Page | File |
|---|---|
| Homepage | `content/pages/home.md` |
| About | `content/pages/about.md` |
| Get Involved | `content/pages/get-involved.md` |

---

### Add a Team Member

Create `content/team/firstname-lastname.md`:

```yaml
---
name: "First Last"
title: "Their Role"
bio: "A short bio paragraph."
photo: "/images/team/firstname-lastname.png"
order: 6
---
```

Add their headshot to `public/images/team/` using the same filename. The `order` field controls their position on the About page (lower = earlier).

---

### Add a Testimonial

Create `content/testimonials/testimonial-3.md`:

```yaml
---
quote: "The full quote goes here."
boldPhrase: "phrase to bold within the quote"
author: "Person's Name"
role: "Their Role / Title"
photo: "/images/testimonials/their-photo.jpg"
order: 3
---
```

Add their photo to `public/images/testimonials/`.

---

### Add Images

Upload images to the appropriate folder under `public/images/`:

| Image type | Folder | Format | Recommended size |
|---|---|---|---|
| Homepage hero | `public/images/` | JPG | 1200 × 900 px (4:3) |
| Events page hero | `public/images/` | JPG | 800 × 600 px (4:3) |
| Event thumbnails | `public/images/events/` | JPG | 800 × 600 px (4:3) |
| Team headshots | `public/images/team/` | PNG | 500 × 500 px (square) |
| Testimonial photos | `public/images/testimonials/` | JPG | 400 × 400 px (square) |
| Site Squad portraits | `public/images/squad/` | JPG | 400 × 400 px (square) |
| Sponsor logos | `public/images/sponsors/` | PNG (transparent bg) | 200 × 200 px (square) |

> **Event photos and slideshows are hosted on Google Drive — not in this repo.** Paste the Drive folder URL into the event's `photosDriveUrl` / `resourcesDriveUrl` fields instead.

Image filenames must match exactly what's written in the `image:` or `photo:` field of the content file.

### Key Files to Know

| File | What to edit it for |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/siteConfig.ts` | Nav links, social URLs, contact email, Formspree ID, Luma embed URL |
| `src/lib/types.ts` | Adding new content types — define the interface here first |
| `src/lib/markdown.ts` | Content loaders — add new `get*()` functions here for new content types |
| `tailwind.config.ts` | Colors, fonts, spacing, shadows — the design token source of truth |
| `src/app/site-squad/page.tsx` | Update Site Squad member names, photos, and links directly in this file |
| `src/app/get-involved/page.tsx` | Swap sponsor logo placeholders for real `<Image>` components when logos are ready |

---

### One-Time Setup Tasks

#### 1. Wire up the real logo
1. Export the M3+ logo from Figma as an SVG
2. Open `src/components/ui/M3Logo.tsx` and replace the placeholder SVG path data with the exported SVG code
3. Logo files are available in `public/images/logos/` as a reference

#### 2. Confirm Formspree is connected
1. Log in to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io) and verify the form endpoint is active
2. The form ID is set in `src/lib/siteConfig.ts` → `formspreeId`

#### 3. Verify social links
All social URLs and the contact email are in `src/lib/siteConfig.ts` → `socialLinks` and `email`.

#### 4. Add sponsor logos
When sponsor logos are ready:
1. Add PNG files (transparent background, 200 × 200 px min) to `public/images/sponsors/`
2. In `src/app/get-involved/page.tsx`, replace the CSS placeholder circles (lines ~172–182) with `<Image>` components pointing to those files

#### 5. Complete the Site Squad page
1. Add portrait photos (square, 400 × 400 px min) to `public/images/squad/`
2. Update the `squadMembers` array in `src/app/site-squad/page.tsx` with each member's name, role, photo path, and link

## 🤝 Handoff & Ownership

### Who does what

| Task | Role |
|---|---|
| Add upcoming events | Content — create in Luma, no code needed |
| Archive past events | Content — copy template, fill in Drive links, push to GitHub |
| Update team, testimonials, page copy | Content — edit markdown files, no code needed |
| Update nav links, social URLs, email | Developer (edit `siteConfig.ts`) |
| Change colors or fonts | Developer (edit `tailwind.config.ts`) |
| Add new pages or components | Developer |
| Add sponsor logos | Developer (swap placeholders in `get-involved/page.tsx`) |
| Update Site Squad page | Developer (edit `site-squad/page.tsx` directly) |
| Deploy the site | Automatic on push to `main` |

### Accounts to transfer

When handing off to a new maintainer, transfer access to:

| Account | Used for |
|---|---|
| **GitHub** — `keykiani/m3Plus-website` | Code hosting and auto-deploy trigger |
| **Netlify** | Hosting and deployment |
| **Formspree** | Contact form and Get Involved form submissions |
| **Luma** — [lu.ma/m3plus](https://lu.ma/m3plus) | Upcoming event calendar (auto-embeds on website) |
| **Google Drive** | Event photos and slideshows (linked from archive event pages) |
| **Figma** | Design assets and logo source files |

### If something looks broken

| Symptom | Where to look |
|---|---|
| Upcoming events not showing | Check the Luma calendar at lu.ma/m3plus — confirm events are published. Also verify `lumaEmbedUrl` in `siteConfig.ts` is a calendar embed URL, not a single-event URL. |
| Archive event photos not working | Confirm `photosDriveUrl` in the event's `.md` file is set and shared as "Anyone with the link" |
| Slideshow not embedding | Paste the Google Slides share URL (`.../edit?usp=sharing`) into `slideshowUrl` — the site converts it automatically |
| Content not showing up | Check YAML frontmatter in `content/` — watch for tabs vs spaces |
| Images not loading | Verify the filename in `image:` / `photo:` matches exactly what's in `public/images/` |
| Forms not submitting | Check `formspreeId` in `siteConfig.ts`; verify the Formspree account is active |
| Build failing on Netlify | Run `npm run build` locally to see the TypeScript or lint error before deploying |
| Styles not applying | Restart the dev server after adding new files; check class names match `tailwind.config.ts` |
